# ProductHUD

A Team Fortress 2 custom HUD originally created by omnibombulator. The HUD hasn't been updated since 2015 and only had menu panels and basic in-game stuff done, so I went ahead and fully finished it.

# Installation

1. Download the HUD (press the big green "Code" button)
2. Locate your TF2 repository. The best way to do that is navigate to your Steam Library, search for Team Fortress 2, right-click it, then Manage > Browse local files.
3. Open the "tf" folder.
4. Open the "custom" folder. If you don't have one, create one.
5. Inside the zip file you downloaded, there will be a folder called "product-master". Drag and drop that into the "custom" folder.

# Customizations

Current customizations are listed below. The number of customizations will most likely expand as time goes by.
* Custom Crosshairs
* Transparent Viewmodels
* Speedometer
* Team Indicator toggle

# Known issues

* In MVM some elements are almost untouched because it's difficult to test them. All the main elements are however fully functional, so do not worry about that.
* In MVM, the wave status panel has some overlapping issues in minmode. Unfortunately there's no solution for that except turning minmode off.
* In Arena mode, the win panel is still the default one. I haven't really bothered touching it for now.
